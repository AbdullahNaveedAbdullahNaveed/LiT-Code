/** The event manager is the common class used by all autonomous opmodes to control the other
 * parts of the program.  The event manager instantiates (creates an instance of) each EPS
 * (Navigation and Actions), and starts each running in its own thread.  This class uses list(s)
 * of events from a configuration file or object specified by the opmode that creates it.
 * Each configuration can contain a different combination and order of Navigation and Actions
 * events, allowing for multiple different autonomous opmodes to be created fairly easily.
