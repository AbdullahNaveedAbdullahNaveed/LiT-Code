To get the github logs, open the git shell and change to the LiT-Code directory ("cd LiT-Code").

Then copy and paste (right click in the git shell window) the following line:
git log --pretty=format:"%w(0,0,4)commit %H%nAuthor: %an%nDate: %cd%nSubject: %B%n" --date=short --reverse > gitlog.log

This will create a gitlog.log file in the LiT-Code folder, open it, go to the end and copy the logs that have not
yet been added to the GitHub Commit Logs word document.

When you paste the new logs onto the end of the last page, make sure they match the following formatting
(You can just CTRL + A to select it all):
- Font size 12
- Font: Calibri (Body)
- Line spacing 1.0
- Remove space before and after paragraph (should be near the Line spacing option, possibly in a drop down menu)
	- DO NOT manually remove any empty lines (except an extra one when you pasted in the new logs),
		this will mess up the formatting of the document
- Change font color to black lighter 25% (to preserve ink)

Next print out only the last few pages that contain the logs you added (ie if unsure start with the
last page # currently in the notebook).

Lastly, update the "Last Updated: MM/DD/YYYY" date on the first page heading to the current date, and print this
first page and put itin the notebook.
